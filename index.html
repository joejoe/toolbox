		<br /><br /><br />
		Get your new server starting at $2.50 here: <a href="https://manage.tektonic.net/?affid=115">https://tektonic.com/</a>. <br /><br />...THEN hire me below to build one of the following products:
		<br /><br />
		Current Products:<br>
		<ul class="ulli">
			<li><a href="#webserver">Web Server</a> </li>
							<li><a href="#emailserver">Email Server</a> </li>
						<li><a href="#crmserver">CRM / Training Server</a> </li>
					</ul>
		<br/>
		<span class="headerstyle" id="webserver">Product 1: WEB SERVER.</span></b><br /><br />Price: $133.00<br /><br />
		What: Your own webserver to host your domain or 1000 domains if you'd like. You'll get set it up for one, and you can add more as needed....it's your server.
		Methodology: If you don't have a physical box in a datacenter, get a server in the "cloud." One option is a server at Tektonic at 2GB and 30Gb storage for about $12.00 per month here: <a href="https://manage.tektonic.net/?affid=115">https://tektonic.com/</a>. If you setup a basic account I can then configure it for you.<br><br>
		- What that gives you: One Windows web server or Linux web server (your choice but choose Linux if you're not using .NET, or aren't sure) and bandwidth.<br><br>
		- Meaning: If your domain is XYZ.com, your website will now work via this server, all yours. No domain? I can get you one for $.99 at GoDaddy for a year. <br><br>
	
		<span id="howitworks_webserver">- How it works:</span><br>
		<ul><li>Get your server (above instructions).</ul>
		<ul><li>Notify me via email (commandlinekid@protonmail.com) once it is setup.</ul>
		<ul><li>I will setup your server.</ul>
		<ul><li>When I'm done (and you're happy): You pay me via PayPal, $133.</ul>
		<ul><li>Estimated time of completion: 24 hours.</ul>

				- Exactly what you get:<br>
	<ul><li>Deliverable: Your own real web server. You can then upload your webpages, files, documents, whatever you'd like.
	<br><br>
	<ul><li>My Work to include: IIS or Apache www server setup, Certify the Web installed for SSL, SSL cert installed for one domain, one domain setup in IIS, instructions on email or phone to point your domain to this server (if you don't have a domain get one for $.99 at GoDaddy), all ports opened for 80, 443, 3389, and 21 (I will setup regular FTP, if you want SFTP you can do this easily yourself), RDP instructions to you to launch the portal to config, Windows server firewall disabled, IPV6 disabled, FTP server setup for your domain and virtual directory created, and anything else I think you need.
	<li> Note: If you want the PHP version I am equally qualified and will setup Apache or NGINX, certs, PHP, Python, LAMP stuff, and get you your linux login. Either option is yours and I like both equally but for different purposes.
	<li>30 minutes close of on-call voice support on the telephone if you need help.
	<li>Once it's setup I'm out of the picture, no support.</ul></ul>

	<ul>
		 <li>Estimated time of completion: 24 hours.
		 <li> Additional Benefit: You will now have your own web server which you can grow, MOVE to another server keeping your config, etc. You will have the Start to a "big boy setup" which you can run with and grow the rest of your life. You will now be able to download via FTP all of your files regularly including configs to backup and won't need to rely-on-anybody to run your stuff. 
		 <li> Additional Benefit: Do you have 10 domain names? Put them on there! You can do whatever you want after I set it up and SSL will work for all of them.
		 </ul>

		<span class="headerstyle" id="emailserver">Product 2: EMAIL SERVER.</span></b><br /><br />Price: $333.00<br /><br />
		What: Your own email to host your domain or 1000 domains if you'd like. You'll get set it up for one, and you can add more as needed....it's your server.
				Methodology: If you don't have a physical box in a datacenter, get a server in the "cloud."

If you setup a basic account I can then configure it for you.<br><br>
		- Technical: I will setup IMAP and SMTP using Dovecot and Postfix. I will setup webmail using Rainloop. And I will start you off with some blocking scripts and other scripts plus set up your server and configure it. I will also setup SPF and DKIM on your DNS, and test all. I will get you certs for mail. smtp. and imap. so your client configurations are easier. And I will setup a bunch of other stuff I do as standard-practice when setting up an email server.
